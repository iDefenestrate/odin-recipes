write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

This is the HTML recipe project as assigned by the Odin Project cirriculum.

End of Project Review:

Applied HTML boilerplates to recipe pages.
Applied knowledge of links and images to recipe pages.
First time using Git & Github in a project; got accustomed to it.

Notes:

1. Get to correct directory
2. Git Status --> Git Add "file" --> Git Status --> Git commit -m "message" --> Git Log --> Git Push
3. Git Restore "file" to undo un-pushed changes
